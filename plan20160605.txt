Things that still need to be done (CORE):
1) Method to identify card effects and what they do.
2) Methods of cards (placement, attack, etc).
3) Implementation of hero and hero power.
4) Interaction between cards (taunts, divine shields, etc).
5) Players must be able to create decks by looking through their collection of cards.
6) Players must be able to battle the AI. AI should not play like a potato.
7) Display in terminal.

Extra things:
1) Different decks for AI's.
2) Saving.
3) Try processing (only if there is A LOT of time left).

- The order of things that still need to be done must be followed.
- 5, 6, and 7 MUST be done collaboratively. Everything else can be done individually.
