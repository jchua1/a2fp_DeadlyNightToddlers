Things that still need to be done (CORE):
1) Methods of cards (placement, attack, etc).
2) Implementation of hero and hero power.
3) Players must be able to create decks by looking through their collection of cards.
4) Players must be able to battle the AI. AI should not play like a potato.
5) Display in terminal.
6) Method to identify card effects and what they do. Interaction between cards.

Extra things:
1) Different decks for AI's.
2) Saving.
3) Card effects can be removed if other processes require attention. A basic version of the game where minions attack each other can be created.
3) Try processing (only if there is A LOT of time left).

- The order of things that still need to be done must be followed.
- 5, 6, and 7 MUST be done collaboratively. Everything else can be done individually.
